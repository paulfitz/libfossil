They said it could notte be done [1].  They were probably right.

What would it take to librify fossil?  Probably a lot.  This is a stub.

Compiling

  * do `./fetch_fossil.sh` to get fossil source (not included here)
  * `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`
  * if all works out, can run `RUBYLIB=$PWD/lib ruby ../bindings/test.rb`
